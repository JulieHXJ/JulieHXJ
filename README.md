This is Julie (Xiaojun Huang), currently studying at 42 Heilbronn.

I explore code with the same curiosity that once drove me as a music producer and music theory teacher — always seeking the elegant connection between theory and practice.

- 👩‍💻 About Me
  - Curious mind with a love for theory — from mathematics to algorithms and their real-world applications.
  - Completed all core C projects at 42.
  - Currently adapting to C++.
  - Got hands-on with AI models recently — looking to explore AI more deeply.
  -  Recharging with outdoor activities and quality time with my dog — keeping both body and mind active.

“I love discovering the structures beneath complexity — whether it’s harmony in music, elegance in code, or patterns in life.”
